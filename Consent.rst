Welcome and Consent
+++++++++++++++++++

Thank you for participating in this online research study conducted by the Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Lab (SNAPlab) at Purdue University! We appreciate it!

Purpose
=======
The purpose of this research is to measure how humans perceive sounds and extract information from sounds. From these measurements, we hope to infer how components of the human auditory system (our ears and parts of the brain that help us interpret sounds) work. The long-term goals are to help those whose hearing is impaired, and to help improve how machines process sounds. Conducting experiments over the web allows us to reach a much larger and more diverse set of subjects than is possible in normal laboratory studies.

Nature of Tasks
===============
This study consists of many questions that involve:

(1) Listening to sounds and making judgments (e.g., which of these three sounds is quietest/softest?)
(2) Answering simple survey questions about yourself (e.g., what is your age?)
(3) Looking at images and making judgements (e.g., Which way is the arrow pointing?)

Privacy/Confidentiality
=======================
We will **never** ask for any information that will identify you (e.g., name, email address, full date of birth etc.). We will only request that you provide your <PARTICIPANT MARKETPLACE> ID. We may ask for this ID in multiple places, just to be sure. For security and functionality, our website uses “cookies” (small bits of information that we will ask your browser to store).


Payment
=======
You will be paid for your time as described on <PARTICIPANT MARKETPLACE>. Further payment breakdowns (if this is a multipart study) will be detailed on the study page that you will be taken to next after you provide consent.

Opting Out
==========
Participation is voluntary and you can opt-out of the study at any time. If this is a multipart study, you will be compensated for the parts that you complete.

Contacting the Researcher
=========================

If you encounter any problems with our website or this study, you can contact the researcher anonymously via <PARTICIPANT MARKETPLACE>. We will respond to your messages within 3-4 days (usually faster).

If all of this sounds OK to you, please check the consent checkbox below and enter your <PARTICIPANT MARKETPLACE> ID to continue.
