  Welcome to Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception Lab (SNAPlab)'s online portal!
  SNAPlab is part of the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/hhs/slhs/index.html"> Department of Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences </a>, and the <a href="http://engineering.purdue.edu/BME"> Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering </a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/"> Purdue University</a>. At SNAPlab, we study the biological computations and neural circuits that underlie auditory perception. In particular, we are interested in how our ears and brains help us listen in complex everyday environments such as crowded restaurants and busy streets. This website is used by members of SNAPlab to host online listening experiments. </p>

  <p> We are still in the development and testing phase of this website. Below is a list of tasks currently available on our website! Note that a login is required to be able to view the tasks and provide your responses, but you can easily create an account in a few clicks. Please click any task below to give it a try. If you are a lab member looking to create and host a new task, visit the <a href="{% url 'tasks-labmembers' %}"> lab members page</a>. </p>
